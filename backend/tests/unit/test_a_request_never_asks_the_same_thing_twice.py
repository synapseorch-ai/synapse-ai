"""A request never asks the person the same thing twice, across its runs (F1226, CAP3's stage 1).

Brief 6 ("keep competitors' prices in a knowledge base") asked "has the knowledge base been created yet?" 18 times
in 42 minutes. The cap on questions (QUESTIONS) held inside each run, but each message the person sent started a new
run counting from zero, and nothing told it what had been asked. Now a run starts with the questions its
conversation's request has asked so far (from the newest run, unless that one saved something), `ask_person` refuses
one already asked — the same kind of question about the same thing, or nearly the same words where no subject is
named — and gives back the person's answer, and the cap counts the request, not the run.
